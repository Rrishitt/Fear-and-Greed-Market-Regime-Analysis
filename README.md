# Fear vs Greed Market Sentiment vs Trader Behavior Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes how **Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs Greed Index)** influences:

- Trader profitability  
- Trading frequency  
- Position sizing  
- Risk exposure  
- Behavioral segmentation  

It also includes:  
- A simple next-day profitability check  
- Trader clustering into behavioral archetypes  
- Business-focused strategic insights  

**Goal:**  
Evaluate whether sentiment drives trading performance or primarily affects trader behavior.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
- Does trader profitability differ between Fear and Greed regimes?  
- Do traders change behavior based on sentiment?  
- Can sentiment predict next-day profitability?  
- Do traders cluster into distinct behavioral archetypes?  
- What strategic insights can management derive?

## 🧭 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fear-greed-trading-analysis.git
cd fear-greed-trading-analysis
```

### Step 2: Place Datasets
Place both CSV files in the project directory:
```
fear_greed_index.csv  
historical_data.csv
```

**OR** update file paths inside the script:
```python
fear_path = "path/to/fear_greed_index.csv"
trader_path = "path/to/historical_data.csv"
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run
From the terminal:
```bash
python "Fear Greed Trading Analysis.py"
```

The script will:
- Load and clean datasets  
- Align sentiment with trading data  
- Compute daily account-level metrics  
- Generate visualizations  
- Perform predictive probability check  
- Perform trader clustering  
- Print business-level insights

## 📈 Output Generated

### Console Output Includes
- Regime summary statistics  
- Median PnL comparison  
- Win rate comparison  
- Trade frequency comparison  
- Risk exposure proxy  
- Predictive probability check  
- Trader cluster counts  
- Executive-level insights  

### Visualizations Generated
- PnL Distribution by Sentiment  
- Trade Frequency by Sentiment  
- Position Size by Sentiment  
- Risk (Absolute PnL) by Sentiment  
- Time-series Median PnL  
- Trader Archetype Scatter Plot  

---

## 💡 Key Findings
- Traders trade more frequently during **Fear** regimes.  
- Traders increase position size during **Greed** regimes.  
- Risk exposure is higher during **Fear** periods.  
- Profitability differences between regimes are modest.  
- Sentiment alone has weak predictive power.  
- Traders cluster into distinct behavioral archetypes.  

---

## 🧠 Business Implications
- Sentiment affects **trading behavior** more than **profitability**.  
- **Risk management** should be regime-aware.  
- **Behavioral segmentation** enables differentiated leverage policies.  
- Sentiment should be treated as a **risk indicator**, not an **alpha signal**.  

---

## 🧮 Methodology
- Daily aggregation per account  
- Median-based metrics to reduce outlier bias  
- Absolute PnL used as a volatility proxy  
- Simple probability-based next-day profitability check  
- K-means clustering implemented using `numpy`  
- Strict overlapping-period data alignment
